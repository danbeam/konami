This is the infamous Konami code hack, where you enter in the following key strokes:

Up    (arrow)
Up    (arrow)
Down  (arrow)
Down  (arrow)
Left  (arrow)
Right (arrow)
Left  (arrow)
Right (arrow)
B
A
Enter

This script will track the last 10 keydown events and trigger document.onKonami if
it detects the user knows the trick, ;).

Have fun,

Dan
