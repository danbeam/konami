This is the infamous Konami code hack, where you enter in the following key strokes:

Up    (arrow)
Up    (arrow)
Down  (arrow)
Down  (arrow)
Left  (arrow)
Right (arrow)
Left  (arrow)
Right (arrow)
B
A
Enter

This script will track the last 10 keydown events and trigger document.onKonami if
it detects the user knows the trick, ;).

Have fun,

P.S. I've just tested this script in

IE6 / FF 3.6                           (Windows XP SP2),
FF 3.6 / Chrome 5 / Safari 5           (OS X 10.6.4),
Firefox 3.6 / Opera 10 / Konqueror 3.5 (RHEL 5.4)

and it seemed to work fine in all these browsers.
